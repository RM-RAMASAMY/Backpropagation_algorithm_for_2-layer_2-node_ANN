# Backpropagation_algorithm_for_2-layer_2-node_ANN
This repository consists of a cpp code for training a 2 layered 2- input 2 output Artificial Neural Network using the Back propagation algorithm, the extent of training being limited to an error precision of 2 decimal places or limited to one million iterations of complete training.
